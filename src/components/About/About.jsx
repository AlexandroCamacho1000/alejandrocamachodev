      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an <strong>Electronic Engineer</strong> with professional experience working as a <strong>Network Engineer</strong>, <strong>Technical Support Engineer</strong>, and <strong>Server Administrator</strong>. I’ve participated in real-world projects in these areas, handling the design, implementation, and maintenance of <strong>technological infrastructures</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working in critical environments has helped me develop <strong>strong problem-solving skills</strong>, <strong>analytical thinking</strong>, and the <strong>ability to work under pressure</strong>. I always focus on <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>system stability</strong>, and achieving <strong>project goals</strong>. Thanks to my experience, I’ve also developed the <strong>ability to work directly with clients</strong>, coordinate requirements, manage expectations, and ensure that technical solutions are aligned with business needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects with <strong>well-known clients</strong> in the technology sector. I’ve collaborated with leading manufacturers like <strong>Cisco</strong>, <strong>HPE</strong>, <strong>Aruba</strong>, and <strong>Dell</strong>, which gave me valuable experience in <strong>quality standards</strong>, <strong>best practices</strong>, and <strong>reliable enterprise-grade solutions</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for technology has always pushed me toward <strong>software development</strong>. I apply all my experience in <strong>infrastructure</strong>, <strong>system architecture</strong>, <strong>networks</strong>, and <strong>problem-solving</strong> to the world of web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, I work as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, with knowledge of modern technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, and databases such as <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I combine my infrastructure background with the development of <strong>scalable, secure, and efficient applications</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to create <strong>technology solutions</strong> that bring together the best of both worlds: <strong>strong infrastructure</strong> and <strong>modern, efficient, user-centered software development</strong>.
